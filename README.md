# Firebreak week serving an ML model client

A simple client side app to make use of the [Mapping Career Causways](https://github.com/nestauk/mapping-career-causeways) project via an API ([source code](https://github.com/nestauk/firebreak_serving-an-ml-model_server)).

## Building CSS

Assuming you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed, you can run `npm run build-css` to generate a `style.css` file. This will also watch for changes to .html and .js files which can be useful during development. For more information see https://tailwindcss.com.
